# Step 2: Simple Doubles: Dummy, Stub, Spy

In this stage you can see how both the application code and the test code can be improved by using the test doubles.
- Setup is simpler
- Performance is vastly improved
- You have full control of possible inputs and system states
- You test individual components in isolation (database logger, database permission checker)
- You don't need to test dependencies outside your control (standard BC currency exchange process - Microsoft already tested it!)
